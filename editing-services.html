  <div class="services__information">
    My goal is to partner with authors who are passionate about their stories. I will work to encourage, correct, and give writers my full attention as I read through their stories. Since writing is a shared love of both the editor and the writer I think it should be a challenging yet rewarding experience, and a journey that I am excited to take with my clients. Mostly I specialize in YA fiction and any kind of murder mystery fiction, but feel free to give me a sample of your work if you think I would be good fit for your piece.

  <div class="services__copyEdit">
    This service includes sentence by sentence tightening and grammatical fixes. I will comb through your manuscript for any oddities of character or awkward phrasings. For a book of 100,000 words the cost will be 0.005 cents/word (For example, 100,000 words would be $500; and 50,000 words would be $250). Any larger projects will be determined on a case by case basis.

    My goal is to partner with authors who are passionate about their stories. Writing is a shared love of both the editor and the writer. As such, I look forward to navigating this challenging, yet rewarding experience with you. I specialize in Young Adult fiction, as well as any other kind of murder mystery fiction, but feel free to send me a sample of your work if you think I would be a good fit for your piece. Manuscripts larger than 100,000 words will be taken on a case by case basis.

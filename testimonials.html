      I am so glad that I chose Allisyn to edit my book. This was my first attempt at publishing a book and she was extremely helpful. I found Allisyn to not only be professional to work with but she has an excellent eye for detail. She caught many of my mistakes and gave some great suggestions. If you are ever going to publish a book I highly recommend you consider Allisyn to help with editing.

      I was amazed at how many details Allisyn found that I never would have seen. Also, she touched base with me a week ahead of time and finished ahead of schedule. It's nice to work with someone who is on time (or early), professional, and meticulous.

      It is a pleasure for me to recommend Allisyn Ma as an editor. She worked with me as my Associate Editor at I Love Chile. She performed so well in the position that it was really hard for us to find someone as good as her when she left to go back to the United States. She is proactive, responsible, and has great editing skills. Allisyn has an open mind and is always eager to learn. She was a joy to work with.

      Allisyn worked as an editor at I Love Chile and she worked quickly and efficiently to edit ten to twenty articles a day for our online content. She worked in a professional and yet easy going manner with our international team of journalists to prepare original articles. I was pleased with her dedication to her position and willingness to think outside of the box.

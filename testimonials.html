    It is a pleasure for me to recommend Allisyn Ma as an editor. She worked with me as my Associate Editor at I Love Chile. She performed so well in the position that it was really hard for us to find someone as good as her when she left to go back to the United States. She is proactive, responsible, and has great editing skills. Allisyn has an open mind and is always eager to learn. She was a joy to work with.

    Allisyn worked as an editor at I Love Chile and she worked quickly and efficiently to edit ten to twenty articles a day for our online content. She worked in a professional and yet easy going manner with our international team of journalists to prepare original articles. I was pleased with her dedication to her position and willingness to think outside of the box.

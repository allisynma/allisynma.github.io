Since this is my first blog posting on my new web site I wanted to take the time to introduce myself to my readers and explain my background in books. 

My passion for writing and editing stems for my adoration of young adult and murder mystery novels. Ever since I was a kid I have lived for the moment of cracking open a new book, a new story that has yet to be read. Anything could be held in those pages. The great thing about books is that no preview or somebody telling you a section could ever relay the entire sentiment of a story. You have to read it for yourself, because the way certain sentences jam against one another and posture themselves against the backdrop of a plot line can lead readers to several different emotional reactions. While a movie can conjure the same type of emotional jerk, I believe books inspire greater depths of feeling, because no character is telling you how exactly that sentence should sound coming from his mouth. You must imagine it.

As I grew older I realized the power of the written word. Auditory learning and everyday conversational words are both things I stumble through. For some reason my brain just simply prefers to write it down, to read. Everyday in school I would be the girl called out in my classes because I had my nose stuck in a book. Also, I would proofread my peers' essays simply for enjoyment. When I graduated from high school I though I wanted to be an interior designer, but that seemed like a hard industry to make any sort of financial gain in the down economy of 2010 in rural Oregon. So I set off to college with a much more sensible occupation in mind, editing. 

I am a graduate of Western Washington University with a major in Creative Writing and a minor in Spanish. Now, the real work begins. As I realized my senior year of college writing does not make money, unless you commit yourself to your dream. So here I am folks, living my dream starting out editing one manuscript at a time, because I would rather be on this crazy adventure of entrepreneurship than working at a job I'm doing for the money.

Since this is my first blog posting on my new web site I wanted to take the time to introduce myself to my readers and explain my background in books and editing.

My passion for writing and editing stems from my adoration of young adult and murder mystery novels. Ever since I was a kid I have lived for the moment of cracking open a new book, a new story that has yet to be read. Anything could be held in those pages. While moives can be spoiled simply by someone telling you the ending, a good book can never be told in its entirety and must be read to experience the full story. You have to read it for yourself, because the way sentences drive and jam into one another against the backdrop of a plot line can impact readers with different emotional reactions based on the language used. While a movie can conjure the same type of emotional jerk, I believe books inspire greater depths of feeling, because no character is telling you how exactly that sentence should sound coming from his mouth. You must imagine it.

I went off to Western Washington University where I majored in Creative Writing and minored in Spanish. This is where I fell in love with copy editing. My daily assignments were centered on reading through other students’ stories and giving critical feedback. I love the challenge of striving to help writers finish their stories through the slippery, tricky nuances of language.

Now, the real work begins. As I realized my senior year of college, writing does not make money, unless you commit yourself to your dream. So here I am folks, living my dream starting out editing one manuscript at a time, because I would rather be on this crazy adventure of entrepreneurship than working at a job where I don’t get to read books all day.

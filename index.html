<div class="about">
  <p>
    Hello. My name is Allisyn Ma (Edmonds). My passion for writing and editing stems for my adoration of young adult and murder mystery novels. Ever since I was a kid I have lived for the moment of cracking open a new book, a new story that has yet to be read. Anything could be held in those pages. I have a huge passion for books, grammar, and people. My favorite genres include murder mystery, YA fantasy, and creative non-fiction.

  <h4>My Experience</h4>
  <p>
    I graduated from Western Washington University (WWU) in English with a emphasis in creative writing. While in school I was published in the Univeristy's independent magazine Inkspeak for my piece "Swiss Cheese and Jesus".
  </p>
   <p>
     I worked for two years at WWU's writing center where I aided collegiate writers in their efforts to compose original work by facilitating workshops for whole classes as well as one-on-one workshops. In these one-on-one conferences I utilized writing and editing tools and research to improve the writer's experience and help them to be motivated and confident in the work they produced.
  </p>
  <p>
     From here I journeyed abroad to Santiago, Chile where I worked as an editor for the news source, magazine, and radio broadcast I Love Chile. It is the most widely read English news source in Chile and I edited  their online content as well as worked one-one with international writers to produce original content.
